Shim plugin to "shim" functionality up and down for CakePHP major versions.
It also provides some small fixes.

NOTE: With 4.x development already being started, **this 2.x branch is now in maintenance mode**. No active development is done anymore on it, mainly only necessary bugfixes.

## This branch is for backporting 3.x to 2.x
or to shim certain 3.x functionality/features in 2.x.

This is super-useful if you plan on upgrading to the next major framework version
in the (near) future. Using the 3.x shims, you can already use the new functionality and even more
importantly the new syntax.
This way you save yourself quite some time, because that code will need almost zero refactoring when
finally upgrading. So be smart and prepare your 2.x application already for 3.x.
All new code ideally is as close to 3.x as it gets, making the future upgrade as smooth as possible.

This plugin requires **CakePHP 2.5+** (ideally you always use the current stable version).
For details see [version map](https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-shim/wiki#cakephp-version-map).

## Installation
Please see [SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)

## Usage
Please see [Docs](/docs)

## Shims

### ModernPasswordHasher / FallbackPasswordHasher
Already use the PHP5.5+ password functionality with the ModernPasswordHasher class and the Passwordable behavior. Easily upgradable to 3.x in minutes then.
That includes auto-conversion (on-the-fly upon login) of old hashs to the new ones via `Fallback` password hasher class.

### Better up-to-date mobile/tablet detection
With the 3rd party depenency MobileDetect - which is included in CakePHP 3.x by default - mobile detection is always up to date.
Use this in your 2.x project now right away, as well.

### More shims
- PasswordHasherFactory to easily load your hasher classes.
- Model::updateAllJoinless() - since 3.x won't join updateAll() anymore.
- Model::deleteAllJoinless() - since 3.x won't join updateAll() anymore.
- Model::get() the new 3.x way.
- IntegrationTestCase (replaces the deprecated ControllerTestCase)
- Shimmed ControllerTestCase (defaults to GET by default) including referrer reset
for WebTestRunner and additional debugging tools.
- Assert query strings (and report usage of deprecated named params) if desired using `Configure::write('Shim.warnAboutNamedParams', true)`
- Assert contain (and report wrong recursive level) if desired using `Configure::write('Shim.warnAboutMissingContain', true)`
- Controller::paginate() loading config defaults and providing query string pagination by default.
- Bootstrap configuration for out-of-the-box query string functionality for CakeDC Search plugin.
- Header monitor via `Shim.monitorHeaders` to assert no output is done before the response class.
- FormShim and HtmlShim helpers for detection of view deprecations.
- Auto-301-redirects (or 404s) for named params => query strings.

## Fixes and Improvements

### SEO duplicate content prevention
URL ambiguity can create duplicate content issues with Google and other search engines,
as they might get a link to the same page in different variations. There should always be only exactly
one possible way of reaching an action.
Using the `SeoDispatcher` filter we can fix that.

### Routing-Speedup
With the `Config/routes.speedup.php` file content you can speed up your 2.6+ routing.
It will pre-compile and cache your routes for quicker [re-use on each page load for you](docs/Routing.md).

### More fixes
- Controller::disableCache() to help to write that directive to the browser for all (even IE).
- Correct auto-aliasing for models' `$order` property.
- Auto-detect and warn about werongly set up paths.

## TODO
- Add warnings about deprecated `$this->data` access in Controller, about request `$this->...` usage in a controller or component.

## More shims
can be found in my [Tools plugin](https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-tools) directly:

### FlashComponent and FlashHelper
A 3.x branch-off that allows stackable flash messages. It uses the same syntax as in 3.x, so you can
flawlessly upgrade without touching the flash functionality.

### RssView
Use RssView (and view-less action) instead of the awkward and limited helper approach.

### TestConsoleOutput
TestConsoleOutput() for stdout and stderr instead of mocks. Less fiddling around.

## Stay up to date
It is wise to always use the current master (latest minor framework version).
This can usually be one by replacing the core folder (or composer config) and a few tweaks here and there.

Read the migration guides of the official documentation on that one.
You can also leverage the [Upgrade plugin](https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-upgrade) to automate some if it.
